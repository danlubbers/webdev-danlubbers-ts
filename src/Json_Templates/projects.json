Psī’s integrated health counseling model has demonstrated decreased hospitalizations in the senior’s last years of life, as well as improved quality of life for family caregivers and their loved ones. Utilizing a digital version of Psī’s model, MA plans will benefit from avoided hospitalizations, referrals to preferred providers, earlier hospice referrals, and reduced total costs in the last years of members’ lives. Employers and commercial health plans also can benefit from employees’ improved workplace productivity and decreased medical costs (anxiety, depression, and addiction).",
